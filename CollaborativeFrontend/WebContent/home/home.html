				<p class="lead">Collaborative learning is a situation in which two or more people learn 
				or attempt to learn something together. Unlike individual learning, people engaged in
				 collaborative learning capitalize on one another's resources and skills (asking one another
				 for information, evaluating one another's ideas, monitoring one another's work, etc.). 
				 More specifically, collaborative learning is based on the model that knowledge can be created 
				 within a population where members actively interact by sharing experiences and take on asymmetric roles.
				  Put differently, collaborative learning refers to methodologies and environments in which learners 
				  engage in a common task where each individual depends on and is accountable to each other. 
				  These include both face-to-face conversations and computer discussions (online forums, chat rooms, etc.). 
				  Methods for examining collaborative learning processes include conversation analysis and statistical discourse analysis.
                  Thus, collaborative learning is commonly illustrated when groups of students work together to search for understanding,
                   meaning, or solutions or to create an artifact or product of their learning. Further, collaborative learning redefines traditional 
                   student-teacher relationship in the classroom which results in controversy over whether this paradigm is more beneficial than harmful.
                   Collaborative learning activities can include collaborative writing blogs,forums, group projects, joint problem solving, debates, 
                   study teams, and other activities. The approach is closely related to cooperative learning..</p>
